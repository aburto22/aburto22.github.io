          <p>Camping near Lake Nahuel-Huapi at the end of La Ruta de los 7 Lagos, Argentina.</p>
        </div>
        <p>It all started in 2014, when I was studying in France.</p>
        <p>When friend told me his great idea of cycling around the UK, I immediately jumped on board. We were supposed
          to
          take 2 months off between the end of our classes and the beginning of our internship. The plan was to cycle
          from
          south England to Scotland, before heading to Ireland.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, 3 months before our scheduled departure date, our university told us that they wouldn't allow
          us
          to leave due to insurance reasons, and that we were required to start our internship pretty much as soon as
          possible after finishing our classes. I was left with a bit of gear I was planning to use during my trip (a
          good
          saddle, panniers and some clothing), and unsure about what to do next.</p>
        <p>When I finally found an internship, I realised I had a 2-week window to get up to something, which seemed to
          be
          fine with the university. 2 weeks seemed too short to cycle around the UK, and as I was living in Nantes, I
          decided to cycle along the Loire River. I would be heading West until Orleans, around 400km from Nantes. This
          would give me plenty of time to get back home and prepare for the start of the internship.</p>

          <p>Sunset in El Valle del Elqui, Chile.</p>
        </div>
        <p>I started cycling on a grey day, with light rain showers coming and going during the whole day. It didn't
          matter, I was off and happy to be on the road. Unfortunately, after riding around 90km, I had to grab a train
          back home as I had punctured 3 times my front tyre, and needed to take a closer look to what was causing the
          issue. Anyway, after getting a new tyre and getting everything up and ready, I was off again.</p>
        <p>This first bike trip, even if it was a short one, was a bit of a revelation. I truly enjoyed being on the
          bike
          all day, seeing the world at a slower pace, but fast enough to get from one city to another. It seemed the
          perfect balance between speed and how much load I could carry. After living in a big city almost my entire
          life,
          the peacefulness and quietness I experienced was the best part of the trip, together with the amazing sights
          along the way.</p>

          <p>Guanacos in Parque Patagonia just off La Carretera Australia, Chile.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Back in Chile in 2015, I was decided to start travelling around my country as well. With Nico, a good friend,
          we rode together through La Ruta de los 7 Lagos, in Argentina, early 2015, our first fully self-supported
          trip.
          Then, it was El Valle del Elqui, in Chile, mid 2015. And early 2016, we headed towards La Carretera Austral,
          our
          longest and most remote trip yet. All those trips took us through mountains and forest, close to glaciers,
          over
          rivers and to the sea. We rode on steep roads, over bad gravel, and pushed our bikes many times. We were
          tired,
          sometimes grumpy, but most of the time just happy, happy to be moving, to discover and to enjoy. We met
          incredible people and cyclists along the way, but the best part was to be able to wake up in cold mornings,
          head
          out of the tent, grab a cup of coffee and look at the mountains, surrounded by nature.</p>
